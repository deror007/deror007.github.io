        <p>During my summer internship with Loughborough University's Intelligent Automation Centre (IAC), I was working on a method to optimise the Zed 2 Stereo Camera.<br><br> This device uses 2 cameras to produce point clouds. Point Clouds are 3D data structures that measure depth for each pixel in an image, this captures information of a 3D scene. The problem is that the quality of these point clouds generated by Zed 2 Camera's can be affected by the environment's lighting. The Zed 2 comes with many parameters that can be tuned to minimise this problem, but finding the optimal setting is difficult due to the huge number of combinations. <br><br> To minimise this problem, colleagues at the research centre and I spent the summer developing a genetic algorithm to search the space of possible settings that produce the best point clouds. Later on, I was able to represent Loughborough University by giving an oral presentation at the 2022 3D Metrology Conference in Aachen, Germany. Here is a link to the recorded presentation that I gave at the conference.</p>

        <p>I have been exploring Generative AI through the book "Generative Deep Learning: Teaching Machines to Paint, Write, Compose, and Play by David Foster". Throughout the book Variational Autoencoders (VAE's), have been crucial to this fields development notably being combined with diffusion models to create Latent Diffusion Models. But what caught my eye is its use in the paper World Model's where an RL agent learns to recreate the pixel observation of a game. Then the agent uses these small reconstructed observations to predict future observations in the game, thus creating a model of the game environment. Due to the VAE's fast and good quality sampling from it's learned latent space, the agent can simulate the environment like as if it was dreaming the environment without using the game's actual observation. This simulated environment can only work after being trained on the environment, in order to learn the design of the observations. This motivated my studies into learning and implementing the VAE.<br><br> Using Pytorch, I have recreated the 2018 World Model's VAE architecture and applied it to the Cifar10 dataset. The images show the original and corresponding reconstructions. There are a few takeaways from these images. The first is that when the dimension of the latent vector increases, the quality of the reconstruction also increases as more detail can be stored in a larger vector for decoding. The other note is that the reconstructions are blurry. There are a few reasons for this, but the main reason is that VAE's focuses on structuring the latent space for better generative sampling rather than recreating precise reconstructions. I am currently looking to improve this model by adjusting the model's loss to produce better quality results.</p>

      <button type="button" class="collapsible">2-Player Bullet Dodger Arcade Game</button>
      <div class="collapsibleContent">

        <p>I really enjoyed working on this side-project. It is a 2-player arcade game where the objective for the red rectangle player is to shoot the blue player by moving with the "left","right" arrow keys and shoot projectiles with the "a","s","d","f" keys. The blue player uses the mouse to dodge and evade the projectiles, and the score increases for every second the blue player survives. In this case I survived for only 6 seconds ðŸ˜….<br><br> I wanted to create this game in order to program simple physics for a potential Reinforcement Learning environment. The "a" key is a green bullet that moves straight at a constant speed. The "s" key is the shotgun key that shoots 3 yellow projectiles at 3 angles. The "d" key is the Tomahawk key that bounces a pink projectile off the closest side wall. Lastly, the "f" key is the grenade key, that shoots a white projectile that can bounce of objects and explodes after 5 seconds. This projectile particularly slows down as it moves to simulate wind or a rolling grenade when thrown. I have used PyGame to produce this. <br><br>Originally this game was meant to be an RL environment for the World Models recreation for my VAE. I created a dataset of game observations by using basic automated agents to simulate game data. However, VAE reconstructions of this particular environment is difficult as the VAE hits a local minima by recreating the black background with faint red and blue colours, most likely due to the blurrying effect of VAE's. These are not useful observations for a pixel exact game like this, so I repurposed the environment as a good-old arcade game.</p>
